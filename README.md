This project explores how to integrate Large Language Models into medical-adjacent systems as constrained components rather than autonomous decision-makers.



This project does NOT aim to:

- perform medical diagnosis
- replace clinical decisions
- provide autonomous medical advice

The focus is on:

- workflow boundaries
- uncertainty handling
- refusal over hallucination
- human-in-the-loop design
